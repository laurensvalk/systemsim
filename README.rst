Systemsim: a Python simulator for dynamical systems and networks
================================================================

A general purpose Python simulator for networks of systems with the dynamics f(x, t).

This package is compatible with Python 3 and requires ``numpy`` for matrix and vector operations, ``sympy`` for symbolic derivations, and ``scipy`` for ODE integration.

Though not required, it is recommended to use this simulator in a ``jupyter`` notebook. Any library can be used to generate graphs, but the provided examples rely on ``plotly`` to generate interactive plots.

This package was developed to generate simulation results in the MSc thesis entitled *Distributed Control of Underactuated and Heterogeneous Mechanical Systems*. Click here_ for more information.
